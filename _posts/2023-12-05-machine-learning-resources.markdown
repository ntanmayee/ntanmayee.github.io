Here is a list of resources about probability, statistics, machine learning, etc. <!--more--> This list is not complete and is biased{%sidenote 'bias' 'My main interest is in causality, which implies that I am interested in Bayesian networks and other Bayesian methods by extension. I am also interested in deep learning, but I am not an expert by any means.'%} by what I am interested in. I would highly suggest you to have a look at a few pages of these books and pick up whatever looks most appealing to you. Most of them are freely available online. If not, it should be possible to preview them on Google Books or Amazon.

## Popular Science books
I highly recommend **The Book of Why** by Judea Pearl. It’s about understanding cause and effect. Pearl won the Turing award (the highest honour in Computer Science) for Bayesian networks, so he knows what he’s talking about. It’s written for a general audience, so there are few equations, and lots of historical context, stories and anecdotes. 

If you are interested in causal inference after reading this, I wrote a blogpost on how to get started on reading about causality. 

## Textbooks
My favourite is [Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/) by Cosma Shalizi. I absolutely love the language and the way it is written. There is enough math to qualify it as a textbook, but it is also liberally peppered with quotes such as - 

> Every time someone thoughtlessly uses regression for causal inference, an angel not only loses its wings, but is cast out of Heaven and falls in extremest agony into the everlasting fire.

I think this is a good introductory book. It is entertaining to read and has many practical examples.

[Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/020217.pdf) by David Barber is a great, comprehensive book for Bayesian statistics.

A good introductory book to computational biology is [Genomes, Networks and Evolution](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computational_Biology/Book%3A_Computational_Biology_-_Genomes_Networks_and_Evolution_(Kellis_et_al.)) by Manolis Kellis.

Some other classic/trendy textbooks are - 

Pattern recognition and machine learning by Christopher Bishop (also called The Bible, or The Bishop Book)

[Reinforcement learning: An introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) by Sutton and Barto (also called Sutton and Barto, or The Reinforcement Learning book)

[Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/)

[The Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

[Distill.pub](http://distill.pub/) - this is not a book, but a collection of interactive articles on deep learning

## Lecture Series
Jonas Peters’ 4 part [lecture on causality](https://stat.mit.edu/news/four-lectures-causality/)

David Silver’s 4 part [lecture on reinforcement learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0)

3Blue1Brown [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) - this is just an awesome math channel in general
