description: Semantics of a Smart city

In September 2015, CSTEP released a compendium of resources on Smart Cities. In their own words, "The purpose of this Compendium is to provide policy makers, academicians, industry and all other stakeholders interested in ‘Smart Cities’ a collection of different types of resources pertaining to smart cities." The compendium may be found [here](http://www.cstep.in/uploads/default/files/publications/stuff/320f73a9fd318538a3d258e8dfe180e4.pdf).

For the class on Smart Cities, we were required to find the similarities and differences between these definitions by different stakeholders. For each definition, the report provides a list of corresponding key-words. I counted the frequency of these key words and made a word cloud.
