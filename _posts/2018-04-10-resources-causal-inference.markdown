Here is a list of resources to get started on Causality, Causal Inference and Counterfactual Reasoning. <!--more-->

## Reading
If you have 10 minutes, read [this blog post](https://www.inference.vc/untitled/) - it's very easy to read, it's recent (as of 18th July, 2018), and gives an overall perspective of why causal inference might be a good framework to try.


If you have an hour to spare, read [*The Art and Science of Cause and Effect*](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/causality2-epilogue.pdf) by Judea Pearl.
This is the transcript of a public lecture by Judea Pearl
delivered November 1996, and it brilliantly motivates why we need
causality, and gives an overview of what the theory
allows us to do.

If you have 8-10 hours to spare, and want to get into some level of detail, read Cosma Shalizi's lecture notes for the course on Advanced Data Analysis. The relevant topics are [Graphical Causal Models](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/lectures/ch22.pdf), [Identifying Causal Effects from Observations](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/lectures/ch23.pdf), [Estimating Causal Effects from Observations](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/lectures/ch24.pdf) and [Discovering Causal Structure from Observations](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/lectures/ch25.pdf).

If you want to understand Causality in depth, read [*Elements of Causal Inference*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-causal-inference) by Jonas Peters, Dominik Janzing, Bernhard Schölkopf.

If you have a lot of time to spare, then read Judea Pearl's classic book [*Causality*](https://www.amazon.in/Causality-Judea-Pearl/dp/052189560X)

## Watching

I've divided the videos into two categories - lectures and talks. Typically, lectures are a detailed series of videos. Talks are shorter, concise and sometimes also explain some exciting research areas and results.

### Lectures
Mini [Lecture Series](https://youtu.be/zvrcyqcN9Wo) on Causality by Jonas Peters at Broad Institute.

### Talks
[*Causes and Counterfactuals: Concepts, Principles and Tools*](https://youtu.be/yksduYxEusQ) in Tutorial in NIPS 2013
by Judea Pearl and Elias Bareinboim.

[*Towards Causal Machine Learning*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooeRlw3U2zU&t=1s) by Bernhard Schölkopf

[*Learning Causal Mechanisms*](https://youtu.be/4qc28RA7HLQ) in ICLR 2018 by Bernhard Schölkopf

## More Resources
A nice introduction to the different schools of thought in causal analysis is [here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01488v1)

Please let me know if I have missed any other resources!
