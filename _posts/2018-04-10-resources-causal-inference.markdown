Here is a list of resources to get started on Causality, Causal Inference and Counterfactual Reasoning. <!--more-->

## Reading
* If you have 10 minutes, read this blog post - it's very easy to read, it's recent (as of 18th July, 2018), and gives an overall perspective of why causal inference might be a good framework to try - [[blog]](https://www.inference.vc/untitled/)


* If you have an hour to spare, read *The Art and Science of Cause and Effect* by Judea Pearl.
This is the transcript of a public lecture by Judea Pearl
delivered November 1996, and it brilliantly motivates why we need
causality, and gives an overview of what the theory
allows us to do.  [[pdf]](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/causality2-epilogue.pdf)

* If you have 8-10 hours to spare, and want to get into some level of detail, read Cosma Shalizi's lecture notes for the course on Advanced Data Analysis
    - Graphical Causal Models [[pdf]](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/lectures/ch22.pdf)
    - Identifying Causal Effects from Observations [[pdf]](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/lectures/ch23.pdf)
    - Estimating Causal Effects from Observations [[pdf]](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/lectures/ch24.pdf)
    - Discovering Causal Structure from Observations [[pdf]](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/lectures/ch25.pdf)

* If you want to understand Causality in depth, read *Elements of Causal Inference* by Jonas Peters, Dominik Janzing, Bernhard Schölkopf.
Free PDF available [[here].](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-causal-inference)

* If you have a lot of time to spare, then read Judea Pearl's classic book
*Causality* [[amazon]](https://www.amazon.in/Causality-Judea-Pearl/dp/052189560X)

## Watching

I've divided the videos into two categories - lectures and talks. Typically, lectures are a detailed series of videos. Talks are shorter, concise and sometimes also explain some exciting research areas and results.

### Lectures
* Mini Lecture Series on Causality by Jonas Peters at Broad Institute [[link]](https://youtu.be/zvrcyqcN9Wo)

### Talks
* *Causes and Counterfactuals: Concepts, Principles and Tools* in Tutorial in NIPS 2013
by Judea Pearl and Elias Bareinboim. [[link]](https://youtu.be/yksduYxEusQ)
* *Towards Causal Machine Learning* by Bernhard Schölkopf [[link]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooeRlw3U2zU&t=1s)
* *Learning Causal Mechanisms* in ICLR 2018 by Bernhard Schölkopf [[link]](https://youtu.be/4qc28RA7HLQ)

## More Resources
* A nice introduction to the different schools of thought in causal analysis. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01488v1)

Please let me know if I have missed any other resources!
