# About Me
Hello! I'm Tanmayee Narendra, a Software Engineer at IBM Research, India. I am interested in Machine Learning and AI, particularly causal inference and natural language processing.

My Masters thesis is on "Causal Discovery for Closed Systems: The Example of Aircraft Engines". Previously, I have been a Visiting Student in MIT Media Lab under the supervision of Sandy Pentland. I have also worked with Fields of View and Medialab Amsterdam in developing a serious game on solid waste management in Bangalore.

In my free time, I enjoy singing. I have some covers on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1n0NKEndfs&list=PLqcR77bpV0rQlXiWEpXeDXIgAzivEEm11) and recordings on [Smule.](https://www.smule.com/triptoes)
