{% newthought "Hello! I'm Tanmayee Narendra"%}{% marginfigure 'me' 'assets/images/profile_bw.jpg' 'This is me.' %}, a PhD Candidate at University of TÃ¼bingen supervised by Gabriele Schweikert. I am working on causal inference from time course data to explore mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation.   

Before this, I worked for two years as a Research Software Engineer at IBM Research, India. During my time at IRL, I worked extensively in the domain of business process management, with natural language processing and machine learning. My Masters thesis was on using causality methods in aircraft engine simulation. Previously, I have been a [Visiting Student](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/tanmayee/overview/) in MIT Media Lab under the supervision of Sandy Pentland. I have also worked with [Fields of View](http://fieldsofview.in/about/alumni/) and Medialab Amsterdam in developing a [serious game](http://fieldsofview.in/projects/rubbish/){%sidenote 'video' 'Here is a small [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhKCXakQbIk) of the game, if you are interested.' %} on solid waste management in Bangalore.

I am also one of the co-founders of Women In STEM Research (WISR), India. At WISR, our vision is to break barriers to STEM research for Indian women and gender minorities through community and collaboration. You can know more about WISR [here](twitter.com/wisrindia).

In my free time, I enjoy singing. I have some covers on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1n0NKEndfs&list=PLqcR77bpV0rQlXiWEpXeDXIgAzivEEm11) and recordings on [Smule](https://www.smule.com/triptoes). I'm also a nature lover and I love trekking. My last major trek was Buran Ghati, a high altitude pass in Himachal Pradesh, India (It goes up to 15,000 feet!).
