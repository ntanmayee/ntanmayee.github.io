{% newthought "Hi! I'm Tanmayee Narendra"%}, a PhD Candidate at University of TÃ¼bingen. I am working on causal inference from time course data to explore mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation.

Before this, I worked for two years as a Research Software Engineer at IBM Research, India. During my time at IRL, I worked extensively in the domain of business process management, with natural language processing and machine learning. My Masters thesis is on "Causal Discovery for Closed Systems: The Example of Aircraft Engines". Previously, I have been a Visiting Student in MIT Media Lab under the supervision of Sandy Pentland. I have also worked with Fields of View and Medialab Amsterdam in developing a serious game on solid waste management in Bangalore.

In my free time, I enjoy singing. I have some covers on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1n0NKEndfs&list=PLqcR77bpV0rQlXiWEpXeDXIgAzivEEm11) and recordings on [Smule.](https://www.smule.com/triptoes)
