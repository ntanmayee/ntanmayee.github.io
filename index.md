{% newthought "Hello! I'm Tanmayee Narendra"%}{% marginfigure 'me' 'assets/images/profile_bw.jpg' 'This is me.' %}, a PhD Candidate in Gabriele Schweikert's group. I used to be at the University of TÃ¼bingen (Germany), now I'm at the University of Dundee (UK). 

I am mainly interested in using computational methods to understand the interplay of epigenomics and gene regulation. Recently, I developed [DecoDen](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.18.512665v1) to separate signal from noise for multi-assay ChiP-Seq. The idea from DecoDen arose while working on tissue-specific [imputation of epigenomic signals](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40211-2). 

Before starting my PhD, I worked for two years as a Research Software Engineer at IBM Research, India. Previously, I have been a [Visiting Student](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/tanmayee/overview/) in Sandy Pentland's group at MIT Media Lab. I have also worked with Fields of View and Medialab Amsterdam in developing a [serious game](http://fieldsofview.in/projects/rubbish/){%sidenote 'video' 'Here is a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhKCXakQbIk) of the game, if you are interested.' %} on solid waste management in Bangalore.

In 2019, I co-founded [Women In STEM Research (WISR)](https://twitter.com/wisrindia), India. At WISR our vision is to break barriers to STEM research for Indian women and gender minorities through community{%sidenote 'community' "You're welcome to join our Slack community [here](https://join.slack.com/t/wisr-chat/shared_invite/zt-uxta1lti-cALZ_5Twr54PApGeUce8aw)." %} and collaboration.
