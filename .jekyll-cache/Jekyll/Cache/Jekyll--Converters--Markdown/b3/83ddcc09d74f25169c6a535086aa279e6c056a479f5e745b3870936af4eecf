I"<p><span class="newthought">Hi! I’m Tanmayee Narendra</span>, a PhD Candidate at University of Tübingen. I am working on causal inference from time course data to explore mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation.</p>

<p>Before this, I worked for two years as a Research Software Engineer at IBM Research, India. During my time at IRL, I worked extensively in the domain of business process management, with natural language processing and machine learning. My Masters thesis is on “Causal Discovery for Closed Systems: The Example of Aircraft Engines”. Previously, I have been a Visiting Student in MIT Media Lab under the supervision of Sandy Pentland. I have also worked with Fields of View and Medialab Amsterdam in developing a serious game on solid waste management in Bangalore.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy singing. I have some covers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1n0NKEndfs&amp;list=PLqcR77bpV0rQlXiWEpXeDXIgAzivEEm11">YouTube</a> and recordings on <a href="https://www.smule.com/triptoes">Smule.</a></p>
